Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to gain experience with the following new concepts: the RPN or postfix expressions, stack data structure.

Project Description

Write a program to implement the algorithm for evaluating postfix expressions that involve only single-digit integers and the integer operations +, -, *, and /. To trace the action of postfix evaluation, display each token as it is encountered, and display the action of each stack operation.

<ol>

 <li>Each digit or operator should be separated by a space, and end with :</li>

 <li>You should apply stack ADT in the program. You can use the Standard Template Library (STL) stack instead of Stack class defined in the text book.</li>

</ol>

Here is an example how to use the STL stack push/pop/top and empty functions which will be used in this project.

 <li>To convert the single digit char c to the represented integer i, a simple method is to assign i by c -‘0’  (for example):</li>
